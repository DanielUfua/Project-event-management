Event Management & Attendee Engagement System
Group Project | Project Manager: Daniel Ufua

This system is a scalable, secure, and user-friendly platform designed to streamline event planning, attendee registration, real-time interaction, and post-event analysis. It integrates both SQL (MySQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB) databases to support structured event data and dynamic, real-time feedback.

As Project Manager, I led a five-phase development cycle involving database design, security planning, front-end/back-end integration, legal and ethical compliance, and testing. Our infrastructure was built using AWS, with enhanced security features including AES-256 encryption, TLS, RBAC, bcrypt, and MFA.

Key Features:

Attendee registration, session scheduling, and ticketing

Real-time feedback and engagement tracking via MongoDB

Scalable backend using AWS infrastructure with Kafka/RabbitMQ for data flow

Comprehensive testing for edge cases and form validation

GDPR and CCPA compliance, ensuring ethical and legal data practices

Admin analytics dashboard for post-event reporting and insights

Tech Stack:

Frontend: JavaScript (responsive, interactive UI)

Backend: PHP (forms, database connection)

SQL: MySQL (event data, user accounts)

NoSQL: MongoDB (feedback, session activity)

Infrastructure: AWS, Kafka/RabbitMQ, bcrypt, SendGrid/Twilio (recommended for messaging)

Project Milestones:

Conceptual and physical database design

SQL-NoSQL integration with one-way synchronization

Use-case analysis and schema development

Edge-case testing and validation

Security, ethics, and compliance planning

This project demonstrates strong technical design, leadership, and a focus on privacy, usability, and performanceâ€”laying the groundwork for a future-ready event platform.
